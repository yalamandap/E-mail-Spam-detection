# E-mail-Spam-detection
📧 Email Spam Detection
A web-based machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam). Built with Python, Flask, and a trained spam detection model, it offers a simple and interactive interface for real-time predictions.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detection.git
cd email-spam-detection
2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Train the Model (If spam_model.pkl is not available)
python train_model.py
5. Run the Web App
python app.py
Then open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
💡 How It Works
The model is trained using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
The input email/message is preprocessed and vectorized.
The model predicts whether the input is spam or ham.
Results are displayed via the web interface (index.html).

# ✉️ Email Spam Detection

A web-based machine learning app that classifies emails as spam or ham (not spam). Built with Python, Flask, and a trained spam detection model, it provides an interactive UI for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detection.git
   cd email-spam-detection
````

2. **Create & Activate Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train the Model** (only if `spam_model.pkl` doesn't exist)

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Run the Web App**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to: 👉 [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## 💡 How It Works

* Uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset for training.
* Text is preprocessed and vectorized.
* A machine learning model predicts if the input is spam or ham.
* Results are shown on a simple web interface using `index.html`.

---

## ✅ Features

* 📬 Web-based spam email detector
* 🎨 Clean UI using Flask templates
* 🔄 Easy retraining with new data
* ⚡ Fast, lightweight, and easy to use

## 📦 Future Improvements

* 📧 Add email validation and formatting
* 🔌 Create REST API endpoints for external integration
* 🧠 Try deep learning (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
* 🐳 Dockerize for easier deployment

If you want:

* A `requirements.txt` auto-generated from your current environment
* Deployment steps for Heroku, Render, or Docker
* A sample `Procfile` for cloud deployment
* A badge layout for your GitHub profile README (stars, forks, etc.)

Just say the word! 🚀

```

**Tips:**  
- Replace `yourusername` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username.  
- Add your actual app screenshot file (`screenshot.png`) to your repo root or `docs/` folder and update the path.  
- You can add badges (like build status, PyPI, or license) at the top if you want.

If you want, I can also generate your `requirements.txt` or a deployment guide next!
